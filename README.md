Spring Data CouchDB
=======================

The primary goal of the [Spring Data](https://www.springsource.org/spring-data) project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.
This modules provides integration with the [CouchDB] (https://couchdb.apache.org/) database. 

This project is in its initial states, contributions are welcome.  There is much inspiration and collaboration to draw from the [Ektorp] (https://code.google.com/p/ektorp/) project.

Contributing to Spring Data
---------------------------

Here are some ways for you to get involved in the community:

* Get involved with the Spring community on the Spring Community Forums.  Please help out on the [forum](https://forum.spring.io/forumdisplay.php?f=80) by responding to questions and joining the debate.
* Create [JIRA](https://jira.springframework.org/browse/DATAKV) tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on the ones that you are interested in.  
* Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from [forks of this repository](https://help.github.com/forking/). If you want to contribute code this way, please reference a JIRA ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.
* Watch for upcoming articles on Spring by [subscribing](https://www.springsource.org/node/feed) to springframework.org

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the [contributor's agreement](https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup).  Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.
